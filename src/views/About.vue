        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>Currently, I am a student at Seattle Pacific University, studying Computer Science & serving as a Resident Advisor in Residence Life</p>
        <p>At around the end of 5th Grade I started getting interested in programming, and knew I wanted to make a career out of it by the end of Middle School</p>
        <p>I have participated in multiple smaller projects, and am now working on building out a portfolio to document what I have learned</p>
        <h2>What Have I Done</h2>
        <p>More specific information can be found in the Experience & Projects pages, but I have been able to participate in multiple smaller projects, am working an internship currently, and am gearing up to a Senior Year of tons of developmental experience</p>
        <h2>Goals for the Future</h2>
        <p>All of that being said, I hope to move into a Software Engineering job to start out a hopefully long term career.</p>
        <p>Currently, to gain further experience, I am planning on dabbling in the relating fields</p>
